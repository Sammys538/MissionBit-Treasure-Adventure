# MissionBit Text-Adventure Game

#### by Sammy Rodriguez and [Malcolm Angst](https://github.com/MalcolmAngst)


## Description
Hello our names are Sammy and Malcolm and we’ve created a text adventure game for anyone who would like to improve their critical thinking skills and self confidence. It is unlike any other text adventure game because it focuses on improving the user’s self confidence and perseverance while completing the main quest/story. We are passionate about this because we want to motivate others who struggle with self-confidence and critical thinking. For the future, we would like to implement and develop more complex themes to further challenge real world problems and more complex puzzles for the users to solve throughout the game.
